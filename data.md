## The Data Engine is Live

We are currently tracking financial documents and performance metrics for New York State municipalities.

The application is hosted on a separate secure platform.

### [🚀 Launch the App (app.nybenchmark.org)](https://app.nybenchmark.org){: .btn }

* Demographic Data imported from the [US Census Office](https://www.census.gov/data.html)
* Combination metrics like per capita stats
* Charts to illustrate trends clearly

**Coming Soon!**
* Side-by-side city comparisons on any metric

* Category drill-downs (break Public Safety into Police, Fire, etc.)
