3. Provenance is mandatory (document + page citations)
4. Definitions are explicit

- Document: A source financial/statistical document with fiscal year
- Metric: A standardized definition of a datapoint
- Observation: An extracted fact linking Entity + Document + Metric with citation

Primary sources include:
- Annual Comprehensive Financial Reports (ACFRs)
- Adopted municipal budgets
- US Census data
- NYS Comptroller reports
- FBI crime statistics

## Current Scope

- Initial focus: New York State cities (62 total)
- Expanding to: counties, towns, villages, school districts
- Status: Alpha Release with live data explorer
