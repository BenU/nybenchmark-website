The New York Benchmarking Project is an open-source effort to compare governance and financial data across New York State’s local governments, starting with the 62 cities but ultimately its counties, towns, villages, districts and authorities, too. The goal is to make it easier for residents, journalists, researchers, and policymakers to identify best practices, understand outliers, and improve public performance.

This project is **nonpartisan** and **evidence-based**. It prioritizes primary sources and clear provenance (government databases, document links and page references) so that claims can be verified and debated on the merits.

## What you will find here

- Blog posts explaining the motivation, methods, and early findings

## What is coming next

- Expansion to additional cities and (later) counties, towns, villages, and special districts
- A public data explorer for viewing and comparing metrics
- Clear contribution pathways for others to help verify and extend the dataset
