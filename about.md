description: "About the New York Benchmarking Project: a civic-tech effort to make local government financial data comparable and accessible across New York State."
---

The New York Benchmarking Project benchmarks financial and demographic data across New York State's local governments — starting with 62 cities and expanding to towns, villages, counties, and special districts. The goal is to make it easy for residents, journalists, researchers, and policymakers to compare how their governments raise and spend public money, identify best practices, understand outliers, and improve public performance.

This project is **nonpartisan** and **evidence-based**. Data is imported from official government sources — the [NYS Office of the State Comptroller](https://www.osc.ny.gov/local-government/data), the [NYC Comptroller's ACFR](https://comptroller.nyc.gov/reports/comprehensive-annual-financial-reports/), and the [U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/data.html) — and every data point traces to its source so that claims can be verified and debated on the merits.

## What you will find here

- Blog posts explaining the motivation, methods, and findings
- A [methodology page](/methods/) documenting data sources and principles
- A [roadmap](/roadmap/) of what's built and what's coming next

## The data explorer

The application at **[app.nybenchmark.org](https://app.nybenchmark.org)** currently serves 2.1 million+ observations covering 62 cities, with ranked dashboards, per-city trend charts, and derived fiscal health metrics (Fund Balance %, Debt Service %, Per-Capita Spending).

## What is coming next

- **Side-by-side city comparisons** — Compare two or more cities on any metric across years
- **Metric leaderboards** — Rank all cities on specific spending categories (police, fire, debt service, and more)
- **Towns, villages, counties, and special districts** — Expanding beyond cities using OSC data for all local government types
- **Demographic context** — Overlay poverty rates, crime rates, and other variables to make spending comparisons more meaningful
