Every year, New York's cities are required to file Annual Financial Reports (AFRs) with the State Comptroller. This data powers the Fiscal Stress Monitoring System (FSMS), an early warning system designed to catch fiscal trouble before it becomes a crisis.

But what happens when cities simply... don't file?

## The Growing Problem

The numbers are alarming:

| Year | Non-Filers |
|------|------------|
| 2017 | ~120 |
| 2023 | 264 |

That's more than **doubled** in six years. Today, **20% of local governments** fail to file on time, affecting over **482,000 New Yorkers** who have no visibility into their city's finances.

Even worse: **68 municipalities are "persistent non-filers"** who have missed 7+ years of reports.

## The Late Filers Among NY's 62 Cities

Our analysis of OSC data identified four cities significantly behind on filings:

| City | Last Filed | Years Missing |
|------|------------|---------------|
| Mount Vernon | 2020 | 4 years |
| Ithaca | 2021 | 3 years |
| Rensselaer | 2021 | 3 years |
| Fulton | 2022 | 2 years |

## Mount Vernon: A Case Study

Mount Vernon (population 70,000+) is the most troubling case. According to [OSC audits](https://www.osc.ny.gov/local-government/audits/city/2020/09/17/city-mount-vernon-financial-reporting-and-oversight-2020m-96), the city failed to file for fiscal years 2016-2019. The consequences were severe:

- **Lost their credit rating** - directly impacting borrowing costs
- No audited financial statements since 2015
- Officials couldn't develop multiyear or capital plans

Comptroller DiNapoli stated: "The lack of operational controls and failure by the former city comptroller to complete basic financial functions contributed to Mount Vernon's fiscal crisis."

## The Enforcement Gap

Here's the problem: **there's no automatic consequence for not filing.**

The FSMS can only score entities that submit data. If you don't file, you can't be flagged for fiscal stress. The worst actors effectively opt out of oversight.

Compare this to school districts, which have **zero persistent non-filers**. Why do cities get a pass?

State control boards (like the one that governed Yonkers from 1984-1999) require special legislation. They're not automatic responses to non-compliance. Mount Vernon has been audited twice by OSC for non-filing... but remains under local control with no mandate to improve.

## What This Means

If your city isn't filing financial reports:

1. The state can't assess fiscal stress
2. You have no visibility into spending decisions
3. Problems compound until they become crises
4. Your city's credit rating (and borrowing costs) may suffer
