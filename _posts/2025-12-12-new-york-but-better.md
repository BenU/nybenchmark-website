title: "New York, But Better"
description: An introduction to the New York Benchmarking Project and the case for civic reform through systematic comparison.
---

New York is a place of extraordinary ambition, talent, and cultural vitality.  
It attracts people from around the world and inspires deep loyalty from those who call it home. Yet when it comes to the everyday functioning of government—especially at the local level—New York too often tolerates outcomes that fall well short of what its residents should reasonably expect.

This project starts from a simple contention:

> **Government at the local, county, and state level can be more effective, more efficient, and more affordable if it is more transparent and if we systematically compare outcomes across jurisdictions.**

The New York Benchmarking Project exists to make that comparison possible.

## Why Benchmarking?

Benchmarking is the practice of comparing organizations performing similar functions in order to identify best practices, outliers, and inefficiencies. It is routine in private industry, medicine, logistics, and engineering. It is far less routine in local government, where fragmentation, nonstandard reporting, and political incentives often obscure comparison.

Yet New York State contains a natural laboratory:

- 62 cities, ranging from very small to very large
- 62 counties (a numerical coincidence, not a structural symmetry)
- Hundreds of towns, villages, and special districts
- Largely shared legal frameworks
- Common state oversight and reporting requirements

If one city delivers public services at lower cost with equal or better outcomes, that fact should be visible.  
If another city spends far more for worse results, that too should be visible.

Benchmarking does not dictate policy. It **creates the conditions for informed judgment**.

## The Problem: Fragmentation Without Transparency

Today, meaningful comparison across New York local governments is unnecessarily difficult.

Some of the challenges include:

- Financial data published in nonstandard formats
- Key information scattered across multiple documents
- Separate political and financial reporting for school districts in some jurisdictions
- PDFs that are human-readable but not machine-readable
- Inconsistent terminology for similar concepts

Much of the most important data lives inside Annual Comprehensive Financial Reports (ACFRs), documents that are detailed, audited, and authoritative—but also dense and difficult to compare across jurisdictions.

As a result, even engaged citizens, journalists, and policymakers struggle to answer basic questions such as:
- How much does this city spend per resident on core services?
- How do employee compensation and benefits compare to peer cities?
- Are debt levels and long-term liabilities out of line with similar communities?

## Voice, Exit, and Decline

When local governance performs poorly, residents have two broad responses: **voice** or **exit**.

New York has increasingly seen the latter.

Since the early 20th century, New York’s representation in the U.S. House of Representatives has steadily declined as population growth has shifted elsewhere. While many factors contribute to this trend, governance quality and cost of living play a role in whether people choose to stay, invest, and raise families.

This project is premised on a belief that decline is not inevitable.  
Better information enables better choices—and better governance.

## Professional Government and Patronage

One recurring theme in reform movements has been the tension between:

- **Professional, merit-based administration**, and  
- **Patronage-driven systems** rooted in loyalty, relationships, and political machines

Models such as the council–manager form of government were developed precisely to address this tension by separating political representation from professional administration. When functioning well, such systems can:
- Improve service delivery
- Reduce waste
- Increase accountability

When functioning poorly, they can be undermined by the same incentives they were designed to counteract.

Benchmarking does not resolve these tensions, but it **makes them visible**.  
Patterns in staffing, compensation, and outcomes often tell a story long before scandals or crises emerge.

## What This Project Will Do

The New York Benchmarking Project aims to:

1. **Collect and document financial and governance data** from primary source materials, starting with the 62 cities in New York State.
2. **Preserve provenance**, including citations, page numbers, and source documents.
3. **Publish comparable metrics** that allow meaningful benchmarking across jurisdictions.
4. **Explain methods and assumptions transparently**, so conclusions can be challenged and improved.
5. **Support civic education**, public discussion, and evidence-based reform.

All work is open source.  
All claims are intended to be traceable.

## What This Project Will Not Do

- Advocate for a specific political party or ideology
- Replace democratic decision-making
- Reduce complex policy choices to a single metric

Data informs judgment; it does not substitute for it.

## Where This Is Going

This site will publish:
- Essays explaining the motivation and methodology
- Notes on data sources and limitations
- Early findings and comparisons as they emerge

A public data explorer is in development and will be made available as the dataset matures.

The work will be slow, careful, and incremental by design.

New York deserves government that works as well as its people do.  
Benchmarking is one step toward that goal.
