**Civic reform through benchmarking.**

The New York Benchmarking Project benchmarks financial and demographic data across New York State's local governments — covering 62 cities, 57 counties, and 689 school districts — making it easy for residents, journalists, researchers, and policymakers to compare how they raise and spend public money.

NY Benchmark imports bulk data from the [NYS Office of the State Comptroller](https://www.osc.ny.gov/local-government/data) (city and county financials since 1995, school district financials since 2012), the [NYC Comptroller](https://comptroller.nyc.gov/reports/annual-comprehensive-financial-reports/) (NYC ACFR data, FY 2016-2025), the [U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/data.html) (population, income, poverty), and the [OSC Fiscal Stress Monitoring System](https://www.osc.ny.gov/local-government/fiscal-monitoring) (fiscal and environmental stress scores). The OSC does invaluable work collecting standardized financial reports from local governments across the state. NY Benchmark builds on that data by normalizing it for population and enrollment, computing key ratios, and presenting it in comparative dashboards. The full dataset is also available to AI tools via [MCP](/mcp/).

**Coming soon:** NYSED outcomes data (graduation rates, test scores), side-by-side city comparisons, metric-specific leaderboards, and category drill-downs.
