**Civic reform through benchmarking.**

The New York Benchmarking Project is an open-source effort to benchmark financial and demographic data across New York State's local governments — covering 62 cities and 689 school districts, with plans to expand to towns, villages, counties, and special districts — making it easy for residents, journalists, researchers, and policymakers to compare how they raise and spend public money.

NY Benchmark imports bulk data from the [NYS Office of the State Comptroller](https://www.osc.ny.gov/local-government/data) (city financials since 1995, school district financials since 2012), the [U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/data.html) (population, income, poverty), and the [NYS Education Department](https://data.nysed.gov/) (enrollment, graduation rates, assessment results). The OSC does invaluable work collecting standardized financial reports from local governments across the state. NY Benchmark builds on that data by normalizing it for population and enrollment, computing key ratios, and presenting it in comparative dashboards.

**Today:** 975,000+ data points covering 62 cities and 689 school districts. City dashboards with ranked fiscal health metrics, trend charts, and filing compliance tracking. School district scatter plot comparisons across per-pupil spending, administrative overhead, and state aid dependency.

**Coming soon:** NYSED outcomes data (graduation rates, test scores), side-by-side city comparisons, metric-specific leaderboards, category drill-downs, and expansion to NYC, towns, villages, and counties.
