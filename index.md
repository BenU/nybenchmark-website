**Civic reform through benchmarking.**

The New York Benchmarking Project is an open-source effort to compare
governance and financial data across New York State’s 62 cities, with
the goal of improving efficiency, transparency, and outcomes.

The project focuses on careful extraction of data from primary source
documents (such as Annual Comprehensive Financial Reports) and the use
of benchmarking to identify best practices and outliers.
