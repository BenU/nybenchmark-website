This project benchmarks New York State local governments using data drawn from **primary source documents** (for example: Annual Comprehensive Financial Reports (ACFRs), adopted budgets, and other audited or official materials). The goal is to publish comparable metrics with clear provenance so that readers can evaluate claims, reproduce results, and improve the dataset.

## Scope (current)

Initial coverage focuses on a small set of New York State cities while the data model, definitions, and workflow are refined. Over time, the project aims to expand to:

- All 62 New York State cities
- Counties, towns, villages, and special districts
- Comparable datasets in other states

## Data principles

### 1) Primary sources first
Where possible, metrics are taken from audited or official publications rather than secondary summaries.

### 2) Provenance is mandatory
Each data point should be traceable to:
- the source document,
- the fiscal year (or reporting period),
- and the specific page or table where it appears.

### 3) Conservative interpretation
When terminology or presentation differs across jurisdictions, the project prefers conservative, well-documented mappings over aggressive normalization.

### 4) Definitions are explicit
Benchmarking requires clear definitions. Metrics may be revised as better definitions emerge. When revisions occur, the project aims to preserve an audit trail rather than overwrite history.

### 5) Comparisons require context
Benchmarking is most meaningful when comparing peers. Over time, the project will incorporate contextual variables (e.g., population, poverty rates, density, service responsibilities) to reduce apples-to-oranges comparisons.

## Common limitations

- Documents are often published as PDFs and not machine-readable.
- Reporting practices differ across jurisdictions and over time.
- Some functions (especially education) may be reported separately in distinct entities.
- Key concepts (fund balance categories, net position, debt, pensions/OPEB) require careful interpretation.

## Corrections and contributions

This project is open source. If you believe a metric is incorrect or ambiguous, please open an issue with:
- the city/entity,
- the fiscal year,
- the specific metric,
- and a citation to the relevant page(s).

Methods will evolve as the dataset grows; changes will be documented publicly.
