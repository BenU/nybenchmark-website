# New York Benchmarking Project — Website

**Civic reform through benchmarking.**

This repository contains the public-facing website and blog for the
New York Benchmarking Project, an open-source effort comparing governance
and financial data across New York State’s 62 cities to improve efficiency,
transparency, and outcomes.

The project focuses on careful, documented extraction of data from primary
source materials (such as Annual Comprehensive Financial Reports) and the
use of benchmarking to identify best practices, outliers, and areas for
reform.

## Status

Early-stage and exploratory.

Initial efforts focus on:
- Establishing methodology and standards
- Publishing background and explanatory essays
- Documenting data sources and assumptions

A public data explorer and application are planned but not yet available.

## Principles

- Nonpartisan and evidence-based
- Emphasis on primary sources and citations
- Transparency in methods and assumptions
- Open source by default

## Related Repositories

- `nybenchmark-app` — Data collection, validation, and exploration application (planned)
