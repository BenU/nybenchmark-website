# New York Benchmarking Project — Website

**Civic reform through benchmarking.**

This repository contains the public-facing website and blog for the
New York Benchmarking Project, an effort to benchmark
financial and demographic data across New York State's local
governments — starting with 62 cities and expanding to towns, villages,
counties, and special districts — making it easy to compare how they
raise and spend public money.

The project imports bulk data from the NYS Office of the State
Comptroller (61 cities, financial data since 1995) and the U.S.
Census Bureau (population, income, poverty), then computes derived
metrics and comparative rankings. Individual city ACFRs are consulted
for quality assurance and validation, not primary data entry.

## Status

**Live.** The data explorer at [app.nybenchmark.org](https://app.nybenchmark.org)
serves 2.1 million+ observations covering 62 cities, with ranked dashboards,
trend charts, and derived fiscal health metrics.

## Principles

- Nonpartisan and evidence-based
- Official government data sources (OSC, Census Bureau)
- Transparency in methods and assumptions
- Accessible by default
